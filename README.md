Nostra
=========

Generates random-ish fortune-teller text. 

## Installation

    npm install nostra

## Usage

    var nostra = require('nostra');

    var fortune = nostra.generate();
  
## Tests

Components:
- [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) JavaScript test framework.
- [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) for continuous integration.
- [Istanbul](http://gotwarlost.github.io/istanbul/) and [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/) for code coverage.

    
## ES6 -- Publishing to npm handled by configuring the package.json file
- See `build` and `prepublish` (which calls build) in the `scripts` section.
- The .npmignore file contains the `src` dir -- it doesn't get published to npm.
- The .gitignore file contains the `dist` dir -- it doesn't get saved to git
- In `package.json`, `main` points to the file at './dist/index.js'

## ES6 -- Testing
- The test file should call the files in the `dist` directory, not the `src`.
- See `test` in the `scripts` section -- make sure it builds before it runs the tests.
